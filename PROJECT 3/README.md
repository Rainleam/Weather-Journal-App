# Weather Journal App

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to
dynamically update the UI in a Weather Journal application. 

##Files

The starter code was provided to me by Udacity.

##Instructions

You need to have Node.js and npm locally installed. You can modify the server.js file and the
website/app.js file. You can see index.html for element references and you can use style.css to
style your application to customized perfection.
